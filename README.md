# signout
## Boat signout app

### Hey Luke - feel free to tinker and bring it out of 1996

### Intention is to get this on a raspberry pi with a GPRS connection (running locally, storing remotely) at the club so that a "forgotten signout/hazards/person tracker" can be online and connected to the same database

### Cheers!

my TODOS:
- set up mysql on aws - figure out how to migrate this in one piece and how this can be automated
- add to an AWS resource
- hazards - collection and communication of hazards on the river
