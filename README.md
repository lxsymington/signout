# Signout

## Boat signout app

### Hey Luke - feel free to tinker and bring it out of 1996

### Intention is to get this on a raspberry pi with a GPRS connection (running locally, storing remotely) at the club so that a "forgotten signout/hazards/person tracker" can be online and connected to the same database

### Cheers

TODOS:
- ~~set up mysql on aws - figure out how to migrate this in one piece and how this can be automated~~
  - ~~set up on aws rdb - didn't get automated but idc~~
  
- ~~add to an AWS ec2 instance~~ - tested and works
- ~~hazards - collection and communication of hazards on the river~~
- ~~Password storage~~, reset requests (?)
- ~~Some responsiveness to say that the boat has been booked succesfullyNAH~~
- login management - username taken etc
- all of the messaging layer - pinging people when they forget to sign back in - creating some kind of notification if someone is vulnerable (weather connection?)
- ~~User profile - requires user to be logged in~~
- ~~Clubs & Validation linked to user profile~~
- new boat/user validation
- Connect to the booking system
- get a domain.... link to signout.minervabath...
- link for booking
